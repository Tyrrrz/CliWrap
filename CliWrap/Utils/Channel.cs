// This is a very simple channel implementation used to convert push-based streams into pull-based.
// Back-pressure is performed using a write lock. Only one publisher may write at a time.
// Only one message is buffered and read at a time.

// Flow:
// - Write lock is released initially, read lock is not
// - Consumer waits for read lock
// - Publisher claims write lock, writes a message, releases a read lock
// - Consumer goes through, claims read lock, reads one message, releases write lock
// - Process repeats until the channel transmission is terminated
