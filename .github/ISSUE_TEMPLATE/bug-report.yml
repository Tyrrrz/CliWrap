        - Avoid generic or vague titles such as "Something's not working" or "A couple of problems" — be as descriptive as possible.
        - Keep your issue focused on one single problem. If you have multiple bug reports, please create a separate issue for each of them.
        - Issues should represent **complete and actionable** work items. If you are unsure about something or have a question, please start a [discussion](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/CliWrap/discussions/new) instead.
